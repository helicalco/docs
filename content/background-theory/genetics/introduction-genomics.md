# Introduction to Genomics



## What is Genomics
  - We know that genetics is the study of individual genes
  - genomics is the idea of studying all the genes and the interactions they have with each other - the study of the genome and it’s environment
  - Process
      - Get DNA from cell
      - Sequence DNA
      - Compare Sequence to a sequence of another organism
## Genome
  - set of instructions needed to create an organism
  - Stored in cells as DNA
  - DNA
      - **D**eoxyribo**N**ucleic **A**cid
      - Double helix structure, Two strands bound to one another.
      - Nucleic acid
          - A - Adenine
          - T - Thymine
          - C - Cytosine
          - G - Guanine
          - Binding of Base Pairs
              - A only binds with T
              - C only binds with G
              - Nucleotide → base pair
- What is each functional unit of DNA
    - A gene

Base pairs organised into chromosomes - pairs - 1 set from each parents

Genes - in chromosome 500-4000 per chromosome

## Gene Expression

- DNA gets transcribed to RNA - non-coding gets spliced out
- RNA is single strand
- RNA is translated in the ribosome into protein.
- Each group of 3 nucleotides is a codon, that codon gets translated into an amino acid.
- Amino acid is the building block of protein

- Gene Expression is the measure of how much the below process happens (how active is a gene)

## Variations

- From one individual to the next there are changes in base pairs. Which could reflect changes in the individual - coat color, blood type
- Variations can be due to
    - A change in a base pair
    - Base pairs missing in animal
    - Extra base pairs
    - Order of base pairs inverted or move to a different chromosome

## Single Nucleotide Polymorphism

- SNP
- A instance where a single base pair has been changed and at least 1% of the population must also have this base change
- How are SNPs found?
    - Sequence Comparisons - Go through the genome comparing bases between individuals
    - Easier when comparing individuals with different backgrounds
