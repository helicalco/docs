# Matrix Introduction
# Matrix 

- Matrix
    - Two dimensional array of numbers
    - Denoted by bold capital letter
    - A mathematical concept that is used to represent relationships between variables.
- Vectors
    - A matrix with either one row or one column
    - Denoted by bold lowercase letter
- Scalar
    - A matrix with just one row and one column
    - Denoted by any letter or symbol
- Square Matrix
    - A matrix with the same number of rows as columns
- Diagonal Matrix
    - A square matrix $a_{ij}$ where everything is zero except where $i=j$
- Identity Matrix
    - A diagonal matrix $a_{ij}$ where all all $i = j$ is a 1
- J Matrix
    - A matrix of any rows and column combination in which all elements equal 1
- Null Matrix
    - A J matrix multiplied by 0
- Triangular Matrix
    - Given a square matrix $a_{ij}$
        - A lower triangular matrix is when elements with $j>i$ are zero
        - An upper triangular matrix is when elements with $i>j$ are zero
- Tridiagonal Matrix
    - A square matrix with all elements 0 except the diagonals and the elements to the left and right of said diagonals
