# Mating Systems

Which animals of the ones we have selected for mating, should  be mated with each other. We should consider:

- the traits to be improved
- the traits to not diminish
- rate of inbreeding
- purpose of mating

- Rate of inbreeding
    - Increases the homozygosity of alleles
- Purpose of mating
    - What reasons are we mating our animals? (protein, fat, milk solids)
- Selection index
    - Mating based on economic importance
        - Would be bad to mate two animals with negative EBV for a given trait

## Mating On Index Values

- Random Mating
    - Mating random selected males and females with each other
- Assortative Mating
    - Positive Assortative Mating
        - Index all animals and mate the best with the best and the worst with the worst
        - Creates more variability
    - Negative Assortative Mating
        - Index all animals and mate the best with the worst and vice versa
        - Creates a population closer to the mean

## Mating Based on Relationship Status

### Linebreeding

- Increasing animals in herd that are related to a particular animal. Inbreeding can take place to concentrate the good alleles in the line.

## Deliberate Inbreeding

- Increase homozygosity of alleles at a gene loci
- Inbreeding Depression happens when a performance trait that is influence by non-additive genetic effects - dominance - takes place. Inbreeding can be used to fix this allele, by making the chosen dominant allele homozygous. Guaranteeing offspring to have this trait.

## Inbreeding Avoidance

- Outcrossing
    - breeding with the most unrelated breed possible
- Crossbreeding
    - Mating animals of different breeds
    - Hetrosis (or Hybrid Vigor) is the superiority of crossbred offspring compared to the average of the two parental breeds
        
        $H=100*Average of Crossbred - Average of Parents/AverageOfParents$
        
        ### Worked Example
        
    

## Crossbreeding Systems

### Single Cross

- Rotation System
- Mating between two breeds

### Terminal Sire Systems

- Breeds that have good maternal characteristics are mated in a rotation system, and breeds that have good performance traits are mated in another rotation system.
    - Two or more breeds in each system
    - Crossbred females from maternal system then mate with best males from performance system - All offspring go to market (not for breeding)

### Composite Breeds

- An animal constructed from two or more breeds. It is created to have the good qualities of each breed in it.
