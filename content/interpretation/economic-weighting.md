# Economic Weighting of Traits

There are $t$ traits of economical importance to a particular species. Let $\textbf{g}$  be a vector of length $t$ of true breeding values. The Aggregate Genotype, H:

$H=\textbf{v'g}$

Where $\textbf{v}$ is a vector of relative econmic values of the $t$ traits in $\textbf{g}$. This can then be approximated by a Selection Index, I:

$I=\mathbf{w'\hat{a}}$

Where $\mathbf{\hat{a}}$ are the EBVs on $m$ tratis for one animal and $\mathbf{w}$ are relative economic weights.

## Aggregate Genotypes

Contains all the traits of economic importance. Not all information may be known for these traits. Includes all the traits the breeder may want to improve or change and the breeder must define their goals. The Aggregate Genotype is the plan to follow.
