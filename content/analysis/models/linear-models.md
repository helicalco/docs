# Linear Models
A statistical model is a way in which we can describe reality using observed variables. There are 3 parts to every model.

1. An equation where the trait observations are describe as being influence by factors
    
    $y_{ijkl}=A_i+B_j+c_k+...+e_{ijkl}$
    

where

- $y_{ijkl}$ - observation on a trait,
- $Î¼$ - mean of population
- $A_i$ - effect of factor $A$, level $i$, on the trait
- $B_j$ - effect of factor $B$, level $j$, on the trait
- $C_k$ - effect of factor $C$, level $k$, on the trait
- $e_{ijkl}$ - residual effect of all factors not observed

1. An indication of whether a factor is fixed or random
2. List of all implied or explicit assumptions or limitation of the first two parts

### Worked Example

## Regression Variables

Also known as a covariate, is a variable that has a particular relationship with the observations. For example the relationship between height and weight of an animal.
