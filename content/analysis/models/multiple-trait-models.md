# Multiple Trait Models

Animals are typically observed for more than one trait as multiple traits affect the profitability of the animal.

Multiple Trait (MT) analyses advantages:

- Low Heritability Traits
  - When a there is a trait with a higher heritability than another, that other trait gains more in accuracy than the high trait.
- Culling
  - Gives a better unbiased estimate of economic value on animal

Disadvantages

- Estimation of Correlations - MT analysis needs accurate genetic and residual correlations.
- Computing Cost
