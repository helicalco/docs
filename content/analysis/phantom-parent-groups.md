# Phantom Parent Groups

In populations there can be animals with unknown parents. It is assumed that these animals came from a large random mating population, with non inbreeding. This assumption is hazy when it comes to two separate animals with unknown parents born 10 years apart. The genetic averages of the two groups 10 years apart are likely to be different, and are likely to be from two different populations. We can overcome this problem by creating Phantom Parent Groups

### Creating Phantom Groups

Phantom groups are to follow the four pathways of selection and year of birth. For instance, an female born in 2005 with unknown parents would have a male parent be Sire of Dam group-2005 (SD-2005) and a female parent be Dam of Dam group-2005 (DD-2005). All other females born in 2005 would have parents assigned to the same group.

Males would go through the same process, having parents assigned to DS and SS paths respectively.

What this is trying to achieve is to identify potentially different populations. There are equations for each phantom parent groups, which can estimate genetic differences between groups. One prerequisite is that the groups are of moderate size. If the groups are too small, some can be combined.
